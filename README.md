# hestia
A computer-vision powered software package that automates your smart home devices whenever you walk into your room.


# TODO (less extraordinarily broad)
-  ✅ ~create a main.py file that uses apicall and cv instead of apicall.py doing everything~
- ✅ ~implement a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming the API 😅 (maybe not so applicable anymore)~
-  ✅ ~Set up and integrate human presence detector~
   - ✅ ~Detect when the room no longer has any people in it and disable everything~
- ✅~Create a web portal and database for profiles~
- ✅~Run website in non-debug mode~
- Connect database/website with core FR program in main.py (UNTESTED BUT HOPEFULLY DONE)
- Make web interface pretty (in progress)
- Verify song_url is actually a URL
