# hestia
A computer-vision powered software package that automates your smart home devices whenever you walk into your room.


# TODO (less extraordinarily broad)
-  ✅ ~create a main.py file that uses apicall and cv instead of apicall.py doing everything~
- implement a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming the API 😅 (maybe not so applicable anymore)
- Create a web portal and database for profiles (in progress)
- Set up and integrate human presence detector
   - Detect when the room no longer has any people in it and disable everything
