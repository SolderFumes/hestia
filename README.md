# hestia
A computer-vision powered software package that automates your smart home devices whenever you walk into your room.


# TODO (less extraordinarily broad)
-  âœ… ~create a main.py file that uses apicall and cv instead of apicall.py doing everything~
- âœ… ~implement a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming the API ðŸ˜…~
- Create a web portal and database for profiles (in progress)
- âœ… ~Set up and integrate human presence detector~
   - âœ… ~Detect when the room no longer has any people in it and disable everything~
